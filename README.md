# Classic-Novels-Text-Analysis
This project uses Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Matplotlib, Plotly, and WordCloud to perform text analysis on classic novels from Project Gutenberg. The objective is to extract insights from the text, including the frequency of words, visualization of word frequencies using word clouds and bar charts, and analysis of POS distribution.

**Description:**

This project uses Python to implement a robust text analysis pipeline, leveraging various libraries for web scraping, text processing, and visualization. Below are the key components of the project:

1. **Importing and Downloading Packages for Text Analysis:**
   - Utilizes `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping to fetch and parse HTML content.
   - Downloads essential NLTK resources like the punkt tokenizer for text processing.

2. **Retrieving and Extracting Text:**
   - Scrapes the text content of "Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan Swift from Project Gutenberg.
   - Tokenizes the text into words and removes stopwords for further analysis.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Creates an interactive bar chart using Plotly to visualize the top 10 most common words in "Gulliver's Travels".
   - Generates a captivating word cloud to represent the word frequency distribution in the text visually.

4. **Parts of Speech Distribution:**
   - Conducts part-of-speech (POS) tagging and plots the distribution of different parts of speech using Matplotlib.

**Benefits:**
- Provides valuable insights into textual content and demonstrates proficiency in Python for text analysis.
- Offers a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing and visualizing text data from various sources.
- Enhances understanding of web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization techniques.
- Easily adaptable to analyze other novels by simply changing the URL, enabling seamless exploration of diverse literary works.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Python, Web Scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Visualization, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Plotly, Matplotlib.
