# Classic-Novels-Text-Analysis
This project uses Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Matplotlib, Plotly, and WordCloud to perform text analysis on classic novels from Project Gutenberg. The objective is to extract insights from the text, including the frequency of words, visualization of word frequencies using word clouds and bar charts, and analysis of POS distribution.
